	<span style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Welcome to the Ethan's Useful Algorithms_1 demo and hands-on-lab project.</strong></span><br />
	
</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family:Arial Black;font-size:18px;">These files comprise a hands-on-lab that demostrates a number of <span style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Useful Algorithms</strong></span> including, DFS, BFS, Ford-Fulkerson, Dijikstra and so on .  <span style="font-size:18px;"><strong> Ethan's Useful Algorithms_</strong></span>1 is based sample application used to graph applications and uses this set of services.  Installing this into you're own Project&nbsp; is a great way to learn about basic graph algotirhms and how you might build applications that consume, transform, and visualize data.</span><br />
